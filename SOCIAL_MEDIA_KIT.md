### Additional Comment (post after submission):
```
Author here. I built MagicTapper because I was frustrated that the Magic Mouse doesn't have tap-to-click like the trackpad.

The killer feature is double-tap and hold to drag. It works exactly like the MacBook trackpad - you can drag files, select text, and move windows without holding down the physical button.

Technical details:
- Uses Apple's MultitouchSupport framework to detect touches
- Written in Swift
- Minimal latency (optimized touch detection)
- Runs entirely locally (no network access)
- Requires Accessibility permissions

The app can't be on the Mac App Store because it uses private frameworks, but it's been working great on macOS Ventura and Sonoma.

Happy to answer any technical questions!
